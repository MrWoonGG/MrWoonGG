## 💡 About Me
I’m a student at PPFK. I enjoy coding, I’m learning it, and I can already do some things, but I’m trying to improve my skills — from **games** and **bots** to **launchers**, **scripts**, and random experiments.  

Mostly working with **Python**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, and **Godot**.  
Used **Java** to write **Minecraft mods & plugins**, **SAMP servers (PAWN)**,  
and even made my own **PHP-based launcher**.

Right now I’m still learning — but I do my best to grow with every project 🙏

An indie 2D game about a Ukrainian patriot fighting Shaheds.  
Fast-paced chaos, memes, explosions — pure energy ⚡  

### 🤖 Arinara
A multifunctional Discord bot with a full web dashboard, music, moderation, and fun features.  
It’s kinda smart, a bit chaotic, but always useful.  

### 💬 VibeBot
A Telegram bot — like *Divinchik*, but with **filters**, **hobbies**, and **better matching logic**.  
Find your vibe, not just random people.
